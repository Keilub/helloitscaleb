<h5>maple!</h5>

We arenâ€™t sure what exact breed Maple is, she is from New Mexico and made her way to us via a fancy private jet (Pilots for Paws). We think she is a Cattle Dog/Australian Shepherd Mix of some sort, maybe Border Collie. She is the perfect dog for us. She loves to be a big couch potato but is always ready to be outside and interacting. She loves fetch. Like, REALLY loves fetch. If she sees a toy/ball, she will not stop until we put it away.
