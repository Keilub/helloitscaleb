##### overview
In the early stages of SMOQE, a local food destination within Market District stores, I played a pivotal role in molding the identity of these spaces. What began as a collection of words, (BBQ, whimsical, and fun) I established as an identity for the brand and space.

##### problem
Full of potential, yet needing a concrete voice and identity, we designed a user-friendly layout with striking and fun visuals to create a cozy lunch spot for locals.

##### solution
I sketched, created mood boards, and strategized based on customer data and team desires. This led to a social campaign to draw foodies in with the unique offerings of this unique eatery.

##### continue to next case study
In a rebranding project for the Indianapolis Zoo, I transformed its visual identity to deeply connect with conservation efforts and inspire action. By integrating nature-inspired design elements and impactful animal imagery, I successfully strengthened the zooâ€™s bond with its audience and boosted engagement in its mission.
