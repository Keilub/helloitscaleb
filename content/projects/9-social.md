With the new, exciting product packaging in place, our next challenge was to ignite audience enthusiasm for the upcoming fundraising season. However, the existing social media strategy presented a hurdle. Spread thin across over 20 accounts, it fostered a fragmented online presence. Worse yet, the tone of these accounts reflected a history of unaddressed user concerns, creating a negative user experience.


##### the challenge
## Meet Their Needs & Engage
Our goal was to utilize our new refreshed design language with a cleaned up social media platform to craft exciting messages that answered common pain points for easy wins as well as informing users on new and exciting things coming to the fundraiser that allows scouts to fund their year. 

Our goals were to:
1. Simplify the number of accounts for the company and its users.  
2. Understand who and why users are visiting our social platforms and meet their needs. 
3. Create a place that is positive that allows excitement to grow, further enforcing our new brand focus of funding adventures and creating life-long memories.
 
## My Role
I led the design and strategy for social campaigns from the beginning of the brand refresh. I led the efforts to evolve the social strategy and to address customer pain-points on social platforms. 

##### the discovery
## User Insights & Ideation
Our plan addressed these issues in a two step approach. First, we aimed to streamline our online presence by consolidating the 20+ social media accounts into a manageable number, focusing on the platforms most frequented by our target audience. This would allow us to deliver a unified message and cultivate a stronger brand identity.

Secondly, we wanted to leverage the power of social media to create a vibrant online community. To achieve this, we would develop user personas to understand the needs and interests of our audience segments, which include Scouts, parents, and volunteers. By tailoring content to resonate with each persona, we could foster a space for positive interactions and shared experiences. This platform would allow Scouts to showcase their achievements, parents to connect and share their support, and volunteers to feel valued and appreciated. Ultimately, our goal was to transform social media from a fragmented landscape into a hub of excitement and storytelling, reigniting the magic of Scouting for the digital age.
