##### overview

The Indianapolis Zoo is a cornerstone of animal conservation and education in Indiana. The organization is committed to protecting vulnerable species. It also aims to advance global conservation efforts. These values need to be reflected in its visual identity. The goal of this project was to redesign the zoo’s brand. The new brand should highlight its conservation work and connect with potential donors. It should encourage their support and engagement.

The new design needed to create a deep bond between the zoo and its audience. It needed to inspire action and build a strong brand presence. This brand presence would support ongoing and future conservation efforts.

##### the list of challenges
## Connecting with Conservation:

The challenge was to create a brand voice that showed the zoo's commitment to conservation. This voice needed to resonate with potential donors and emphasize the zoo’s role in protecting endangered species worldwide.

The new brand identity had to create an emotional connection. It had to connect the animals at the zoo to the audience. This connection was essential for motivating viewers to care about conservation and understand the zoo’s impact.

## The Research
To address these challenges, I started by researching into local perceptions and the zoo’s conservation efforts. This included public outreach. It involved discussions and surveys to gauge how people currently viewed the zoo and where it could improve.

The research revealed something. Locals thought the zoo was good. But, it needed a better story. The story should show its global impact. The data suggested that a new, conservation-focused brand could boost donations and community engagement.

##### the process

The rebrand focused on nature-inspired typography and an earthy color palette to reflect the zoo’s commitment to the natural world. The design aimed to evoke feelings of warmth and authenticity. High-quality animal photography was integrated into the design to create a strong visual connection with the zoo’s core mission. This imagery was paired with modern and clean design elements to maintain a fresh, engaging look.

Billboards and posters were designed to be visually striking, these materials highlighted the zoo’s conservation efforts and featured calls to action that encouraged donations. The map also underwent a significant redesign, incorporating organic illustrations of animals to make it more engaging and informative. The modern layout ensured that visitors could easily navigate the zoo while appreciating the visual storytelling.

The rebranding effort successfully created a new, compelling visual identity for the Indianapolis Zoo. The nature-inspired typography and earthy colors, combined with impactful animal photography, effectively communicated the zoo’s conservation message. The updated billboards, posters, and zoo map not only enhanced the zoo’s brand presence but also increased public engagement and support for its conservation initiatives. The redesigned materials have helped bridge the gap between the zoo and its audience, fostering a deeper connection and encouraging ongoing support for its vital work.
