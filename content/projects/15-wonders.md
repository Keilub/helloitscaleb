##### aquatic price guide // turf & ornamental price guide
In revamping the pricing guides for the Aquatic and Turf and Ornamental portfolios, my objective was to modernize the presentation while enhancing accessibility and readability. I began by simplifying the layout to focus on clarity, using a clean, grid-based design that allows for easy navigation of information. I implemented intuitive color coding and icons to quickly differentiate between product categories and pricing tiers, and incorporated larger, legible fonts to improve readability. To ensure accessibility, I adopted a user-friendly format that includes searchable tables and interactive elements for digital versions. This streamlined approach not only made the guides more visually appealing but also significantly easier for users to find and understand the information they need, ultimately improving their overall experience and efficiency in using the guides.

##### diy product catalog
In designing the DIY product catalog mailer, I sought to streamline the ordering process and foster customer retention by leveraging Excel and InDesign to create personalized catalogs. I used Excel to compile and manage customer data, ensuring that each catalog was tailored with a pre-filled order form reflecting previous purchases. This customization not only facilitated easy reordering but also underscored a personal touch, enhancing customer loyalty. InDesign was employed to craft a visually engaging layout that featured both the customer's past orders and new, exciting products. By integrating educational content about these new offerings, the catalog served as both a convenient reorder tool and an informative resource, ultimately driving repeat business while keeping customers informed about the latest innovations.

##### stricore advertisment campaign
In spearheading the ad campaign for StriCore's new product launch, I aimed to craft a compelling narrative that would captivate both print and digital audiences. I began by conceptualizing a visual theme that highlights StriCore’s innovative edge and aligns with its cutting-edge technology ethos. The print ads featured bold, high-contrast imagery and dynamic layouts to grab attention on physical platforms, while the digital ads incorporated interactive elements and parallax effects for unique and engaging digital elements. By maintaining a consistent design language across both mediums, including a unified color palette and modern typography, I ensured that the campaign not only stood out in various formats but also reinforced StriCore’s brand identity and product messaging effectively. This cohesive approach not only maximized the campaign’s impact but also facilitated a seamless transition between different advertising platforms.

##### seeing is believing case studies
In developing the case studies for SePRO’s new portfolio, my goal was to create educational materials that effectively communicate the benefits and innovations of our latest offerings—ecologically-friendly lake and reservoir restoration products for solving algae, weed, and phosphorous pollution issues—to politicians and governmental agencies. I meticulously curated real-world examples showcasing how SePRO's solutions address these critical environmental challenges, highlighting their ability to restore polluted waters to safe, usable conditions that humans can enjoy. Each case study was designed with a professional and accessible layout, featuring clear data visuals, impactful results, and concise summaries tailored to engage a high-influence audience. By presenting these case studies in a compelling format and leveraging relationships with technical specialists, I was able to secure multiple projects worth millions of dollars, fostering informed dialogue and advocacy for our solutions.

##### western canal market print ads
In developing print ads for the Western Canal market, my strategy centered on capturing the essence of the region’s unique characteristics while driving engagement and brand recognition. I conducted in-depth research on local visual preferences and market trends to ensure that the ads resonated with the target audience. The design featured vibrant, regionally relevant imagery and bold typography that stood out.

##### business cards for all of sepro corporation
As the lead designer I led the tast of revitalizing SePRO's business card designs, I approached the project with the goal of creating a unified visual identity that reflects the company's diverse portfolios while reinforcing its overarching brand, SePRO. I developed five designs, each tailored to represent one of SePRO's individual portfolios, incorporating unique color schemes while incorperating thier portfolio 'taglines' that symbolize their specific functions and values. Despite these variations, each design adheres to a cohesive style, ensuring that all cards visually align with the SePRO brand. By integrating consistent typography, logo placement, and a shared design language, I crafted a set of business cards that not only highlight the distinctiveness of each portfolio but also strengthen the overall brand identity, creating a harmonious balance between individuality and unity.
