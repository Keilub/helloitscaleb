##### the brief
## Motion Graphics
I developed a 60-second educational video to promote SePRO's Stormwater Management Solution, aimed at informing a specific audience affected by Florida's SB 7040, the Statewide Stormwater Rule Ratification Bill. The video targets those who need to comply with the new regulations, including municipalities, construction companies, environmental consultants, and the general public.

To tailor the content effectively, we created a single user persona representing the key stakeholders affected by the bill. This persona helped guide the video's focus and ensure that the information was relevant and engaging for the intended audience.

##### the process
## Engaging with Video
In terms of design, we utilized slightly saturated pastel colors to create a friendly and approachable tone. This choice was intended to make the video more engaging while maintaining a professional appearance. The visual style featured bold, minimalistic vector shapes that allowed us to keep the content simple and focused. This approach emphasized the process of the product and the story being told, avoiding unnecessary complexity and ensuring clarity.

To make the video engaging, animations were used to illustrate stormwater issues and how the product helps. Clear narration explained the key points, and background music kept viewers interested. Text overlays emphasized important details, while the design featured FDEP’s branding and clear visuals.

The script was written to clarify how SePRO’s product meets SB 7040’s requirements. Storyboarding ensured that each part of the video effectively communicated its message. Animations and infographics were created to present information clearly. A professional voiceover artist recorded the script, and music and sound effects were chosen to enhance the educational tone.

The video successfully explained the product’s role in complying with SB 7040 and provided practical guidance on its integration. It garnered over 12,000 views and led to a 20% increase in inquiries about the product. Positive feedback highlighted the video’s clarity and relevance.

In summary, the 60-second video effectively educated users about SePRO’s stormwater management product and its connection to SB 7040.
