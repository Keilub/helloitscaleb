In the beginning selling popcorn was a magical experience for Scouts, allowing them the ability to fundraise for life changing experiences and memories. As time passed this magic diminished as the brand lost itâ€™s focus resulting in a poor experience and customers began to forget what made this fundraiser magic, the life long friendships and memories that is possible with a successful fundraiser. 

I was part of an ambitious project to redesign the products and brand for one of the most vital fundraisers in Scouting. 


##### the challenge
## Recapturing the Magic
Our goal for the project was to recapture the magic of what it means to be a Scout and the experiences that help fuel the development of the kids that fundraise. The original premise was simple: sell popcorn, go on adventure. Our ambitions were to create a strong visual foundation that allows the user base to embrace and feel positive about their support of the fundraiser. 

Our goals were to:
1. Make it simple and easy for everyone, everywhere. 
2. Give customers the information they need to understand the cost of the product and what their donation helps support.
3. Revitalize the brand to give the fundraiser a fresh look that garners excitement from both the Scout and buyer. 

## My Role
I led the redesign of the product packaging between March 2021 and November 2023 and collaborated alongside a Product Researcher, Customer Service Managers, Product Development Strategist, Content Strategist and Executive Leadership. 

I left the project as the fundraiser was going into its second season with the refocused design and brand.

## Starting From The Past

*Previous designs that had been in use for a few years.*

We began by analyzing Trail's End's existing packaging, recognizing the importance of maintaining the brand's established visual identity.  To achieve a refresh, we implemented a two-pronged approach. First, colors were given a slight saturation boost, enhancing their vibrancy without deviating from the brand's established palette. Second, we incorporated subtle gradients to seamlessly blend product photography with the bolder color elements.  Typography received a modern update while adhering to Trail's End's brand standards. Furthermore, we updated some of the product photos to showcase a more diverse and inclusive range of people enjoying the outdoors and creating memories, ensuring Trail's End resonates with all potential scouts. Finally, a drop shadow effect was introduced, not only adding depth to the packaging design but also offering creative opportunities for future social media campaigns and marketing materials. This effect will play a key role in amplifying the brand's core message of "Adventure Awaits."

##### the impact
## Postive Results & Much More To Do
The redesign of the product packaging has had a positive impact on customer engagement. With the focus on kids and adventure the users feel the packaging now expresses their excitement for Scouting, leading to a positive experience for both sellers and customers. However, pricing complaints have not significantly decreased but they have gone down. I believe this to be a change that will require a gradual change over a longer period of time. 

* Increased representation of average user and consumer. 
* 7% decline in customer complaints on cost, with an improvement in social media channels becoming more positive space for fundraiser discussion. 
* 37% increase of sales from previous year
