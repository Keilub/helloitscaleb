In the beginning selling popcorn was a magical experience for Scouts, allowing them the ability to fundraise for life changing experiences and memories. As time passed this magic diminished as the brand lost itâ€™s focus resulting in a poor experience and customers began to forget what made this fundraiser magic, the life long friendships and memories that is possible with a successful fundraiser. 

I was part of an ambitious project to redesign the products and brand for one of the most vital fundraisers in Scouting. 


##### the challenge
## Recapturing the Magic
Our goal for the project was to recapture the magic of what it means to be a Scout and the experiences that help fuel the development of the kids that fundraise. The original premise was simple: sell popcorn, go on adventure. Our ambitions were to create a strong visual foundation that allows the user base to embrace and feel positive about their support of the fundraiser. 

Our goals were to:
1. Make it simple and easy for everyone, everywhere. 
2. Give customers the information they need to understand the cost of the product and what their donation helps support.
3. Revitalize the brand to give the fundraiser a fresh look that garners excitement from both the Scout and buyer. 

## My Role
I led the redesign of the product packaging between March 2021 and November 2023 and collaborated with another design and marketing lead on the social strategy for the fundraiser. 

In addition, I worked alongside a Product Researcher, Customer Service Managers, Product Development Strategist, Content Strategist and Executive Leadership. 

I left the project as the fundraiser was going into its second season with the refocused design and brand.
