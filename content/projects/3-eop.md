The competition has booklets and complex programs. Ours focuses on one easy-to-understand page. No headaches.


##### the problem
## Too Complicated

Every fall, golf course superintendents and lawn care operators face the challenge of finding the best deals on essential products. These include fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides for the following year. Early Order Programs (EOPs) from companies like SePRO offer solutions. However, with many programs vying for their business, understanding the complex pricing and getting the most savings can be tricky.

SePRO aimed to cut through the confusion of EOP offers with a simple 2024 pricing strategy. Simply offer the best deals and savings. This meant ditching complex reward systems. They were common in previous years and among competitors. A big challenge emerged. It is difficult to convey simplicity across many mediums such as digital ads, print materials, website content, sales brochures, social media campaigns, and partner promotions. Additionally, grabbing the attention of stressed buyers is not easy. They face tough, fast, and competitive choices from many suitors.

##### the process
## A Time for Self Reflection
We started by reviewing dozens of past programs from ourselves and the competition. We did this to find a unique visual and messaging space. As with many B2B marketing promotions, competitors used generic, industry-focused visuals that provided little insight into the supplier's brand or what differentiated their offerings from others.
SePRO took a data-driven and creative approach. They chose transparency to show clear value and developed a memorable style. This concept proudly showcased SePRO's simple savings. It achieved this with a design that focused on the savings, featuring clean and simple graphics that are laid out to best showcase the program. It stood out from overly complex competitor programs by presenting an offer simple enough to live on a single sheet of paper. To further empower customers, SePRO's user-friendly digital calculator helped everyone access every deal they deserved. This program uniquely respected customers' time and attention, demonstrating SePRO's commitment to prioritizing their needs.

The 2024 SePRO EOP delivered the highest gross sales of any EOP to date for SePRO. Our new EOP design and strategy led to a 12% sales increase from the previous year. It also led to a significant drop in customer questions about the program. Furthermore, SePRO's sales leadership praised the program's straightforward marketing approach. They noted how it empowered them. It let them focus on sales conversations by cutting the need to explain a complex program. In conclusion, SePRO's 2024 EOP proved to be a win-win for both SePRO and its customers. Customers could easily stock up on essential products. They did not need to decipher complicated details.

##### continue to next case study
Revamping SePRO’s outdated water analysis report was no small feat; we transformed a dense, confusing document into an accessible, visually engaging resource. By incorporating feedback from scientists and modernizing the design, we’ve made it easier for customers to grasp crucial information and take action on their water quality.
