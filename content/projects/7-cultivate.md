##### the problem
## Bring the Past to the Present
The first brainstorming sessions with the design team and portfolio leader focused on creating a booth that was new and different from anything SePRO had done before. Key phrases like "clean and simple," and "red, white, and blue" guided the design. The aim for simplicity was to counter previous years' designs. Those designs were typically slapped-together signage. The red, white, and blue theme hinted that SePRO is made in America. We aimed to showcase a booth that was eye-catching. It could engage a viewer and make them want to learn more about SePRO.
We explored visuals associated with classic Americana. This means bowling and baseball. We wanted to achieve a blend of “nostalgia” and “modern”. Gradients and textures were incorporated to further enhance the designs depth. Leveraging a previously successful bowling-themed carnival game, we repurposed it into an all-ages game for the booth. The combination of ringing sounds and flashing lights proved to be a crowd-pleaser.

## Branding a Booth

> “Just wow. This is a new SePRO. Great booth!”<br>
-Longtime partner in the greenhouse industry.

The previous year's booth design served as a starting point for improvement. We aimed for a cleaner, more open layout. It helped people interact with potential clients. The final booth design embodied our "Modern but Nostalgic" theme perfectly. High-resolution, evocative floral imagery featuring vibrant red, white and blue flowers created a bright environment for visitors. These visuals were punctuated with clean, modern lines and pops of text. 

In our meetings with the team and portfolio leader, we found a big challenge. It was the huge number of products and solutions that SePRO offers. SePRO has many products to promote. Showing them all at a trade show can overwhelm attendees. To fix this, we decided to use a video solution, which also played into the modernity of the booth. It communicates the brand's breadth without overwhelming visitors.

We developed a 15-minute video that played on loop within the booth. The video featured short, engaging stories. They highlighted each of the company's relevant key products and solutions. We offered a variety of extra materials for each product to go with the video. They let attendees take away detailed info. To match the shift to online info, we also put all product details online. This let attendees access it after the show without carrying around paper the entire show.

> “SePRO has the best collateral in the industry. Nothing else to be said.”

Informative and visually appealing handouts and collateral were prominently displayed throughout the booth. These materials showcased products and specials. They highlighted success stories and gave contact information for follow-up inquiries. 
To further enhance engagement, we incorporated fun and nostalgic memorabilia into the booth as takeaways. Pennants featured SePRO products and trading cards showcased our Technical Specialist to double as their business card for the weekend and eye-catching stickers were all available for attendees to take home.

##### the results
## Final Takeaway
The Cultivate 2024 trade booth design proved to be a resounding success. The "Modern but Nostalgic" theme resonated with attendees, fostering positive interactions and generating a significant amount of interest in the SePRO brand and products. The repurposed carnival game not only served as a conversation starter but also demonstrated the company's commitment to fun and engagement. By combining nostalgic elements with a modern aesthetic, we were able to capture the essence of the SePRO brand and achieve significant engagement at the Cultivate event.
