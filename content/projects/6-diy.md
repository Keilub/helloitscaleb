##### continue to next case study
Led the transformation of SePRO's trade booth for Cultivate 2024, I set out to blend nostalgia with modernity, creating an inviting space that would captivate attendees. Inspired by classic Americana and guided by phrases like 'clean and simple,' our booth design not only showcased SePRO's products but also conveyed a strong message of American pride and innovation. The incorporation of high-resolution floral imagery and interactive video presentations effectively communicated our breadth of offerings while minimizing attendee overwhelm. This approach not only sparked significant interest and engagement but also solidified SePRO's position as a leader in the industry, resulting in new distributor partnerships and a substantial return on investment.
