It began with a vision for the ‘perfect’ podcast application, translating sketches and ideas into wireframes and digital designs that led to a full-featured and user friendly podcasting app, Ear Worm Podcast. This quickly became the basis of a comprehensive pitch to potential investors.

##### the challenge
## Accessibility Design

I searched for a podcasting app that offered a range of features, is easy to use, and requires minimal effort to subscribe to your favorite podcasts. Too many apps have complicated setup processes, rely on frequent user engagement to keep going, and lack a modern accessible design. I wanted an app that would be ready to go when it was filled with podcasts and required minimal interaction every time I wanted to listen. From my research the major challenges I faced in designing this app were:
1. Overly Complex Setup: Many podcast apps have cumbersome setup processes that deter users from getting started quickly.
2. High Maintenance Design:  Some apps require constant user interaction to maintain functionality, which can be frustrating for listeners who simply want to enjoy their podcasts.
3. Outdated Design: Outdated interfaces lack accessibility and make it difficult for users to navigate and find what they're looking for.

Starting by crafting user personas, this allowed me to strategize were to prioritise in the early stages of design. Using these personas constantly throughtou the project guided design decisions, priorities, and lead an empathy focused design language throughout the project. 

My personas consisted of 5 types:
