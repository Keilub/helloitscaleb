The Trail’s End guidebook is the center for all data and instructions for fundraising activities at Trail’s End. It is the ideal place for Scouts and parents to visit when they need aid in selling their products easily and successfully. 

##### the challenge
## Simplify.

The collateral was too complicated and muddled the clear-cut sale we were trying to make. Its presentation felt outdated and didn't appeal to our target audience of kids eager to sell and busy volunteers. We needed to focus on simplifying it and making it more modern and attractive.

1. Unclear Sales Message: The collateral was cluttered and didn't effectively communicate the simple sales pitch.
2. Outdated Design: The presentation felt dated and failed to resonate with the target audience of tech-savvy kids.
3. Lack of Appeal for Volunteers: The collateral wasn't engaging for busy volunteers who needed clear and concise information.
4. Complexity for Users: The materials were difficult to understand, hindering both kids' sales efforts and volunteers' ability to provide guidance.
