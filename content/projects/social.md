After the refresh of the product packaging, we were in need to fully engaging our audience to drum up excitement for the upcoming year of fundraising. The social media strategy before I arrived was scattered across 20+ accounts and the discussion and attitude of those account was filled with user concerns being unmet/ignored and overall, a negative experience for any user.


##### the challenge
## Meet Their Needs & Engage
Our goal for the project was to recapture the magic of what it means to be a Scout and the experiences that help fuel the development of the kids that fundraise. The original premise was simple: sell popcorn, go on adventure. Our ambitions were to create a strong visual foundation that allows the user base to embrace and feel positive about their support of the fundraiser. 

Our goals were to:
1. Simplify the number of accounts for the company and its users.  
2. Understand who and why users are visiting our social platforms and meet their needs. 
3. Create a place that is positive that allows excitement to grow, further enforcing our new brand focus of funding adventures and creating life-long memories.
 
## My Role
I led the design and strategy for social campaigns from the beginning of the brand refresh. I led the efforts to evolve the social strategy and to address customer pain-points on social platforms. 

##### the discovery
## User Insights & Ideation
Leveraging insights from our social media deep dive and research, I developed a content strategy that targets the needs of three key user personas. These personas will guide our future campaigns, ensuring they effectively reach our target audience and achieve our goals.
