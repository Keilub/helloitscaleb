##### the challenge
## Bridging Sales and Technical with Consistent, Customizable Materials

The SePRO teams needed versatile presentation and PDF assets that could support both technical specialists and leadership. The challenge was to create materials that are easy to customize for different audiences, distributors, end-users, or internal teams, while staying tightly aligned with brand guidelines. Previous resources lacked flexibility and often didn’t reflect the polished, professional image the company wanted to project.

The goal? To develop editable, user-friendly PDFs and PowerPoint decks that would enhance live webinars, pitches, and training, all while maintaining a consistent visual identity tied to our broader marketing efforts.

##### the approach
## Designing Dynamic, Editable Tools with Cohesive Branding

I began by creating a flexible library of editable materials designed to enhance sales pitches, support education, and streamline internal efforts. The goal was to give team members across all portfolios the tools they needed to present professionally and confidently, without relying on one-off design requests for every presentation or document.

Along with aligning to SePRO’s core brand guidelines, the materials also incorporated visual elements from our current year’s campaign, including pop-out and layered effects. These design touches carried over from the print ad campaign, creating a strong, recognizable visual identity across all collateral. Whether someone was encountering the SePRO brand in print, digital, or presentation form, the experience was visually unified and immediately identifiable.

The language and design approach struck the right balance, technical enough for specialists, yet clear and accessible for sales conversations and customer-facing interactions. The result was a system of branded materials that were easy to adapt, consistent across teams, and visually reflective of SePRO’s evolving presence in the market.

##### results
## Branded Tools to Empower & Grow

The shift from scattered, inconsistent collateral to a unified, editable system of branded materials marked a major upgrade in how our team communicates. What once required multiple design requests and last-minute edits is now a streamlined process, with team members confidently using materials that look professional and feel aligned with our larger brand.

By giving specialists and sales teams tools they could trust and tailor, we not only elevated the quality of our pitches but also saved significant time on the backend. I no longer need to create dozens of custom assets for each team member—instead, they’re empowered with resources that are easy to update while staying within brand.

We also saw greater internal adoption of brand standards. Because the materials looked polished and matched the year’s visual campaign, they became the go-to resources for everything from distributor meetings to internal training.
* Enabled confident, effective communication across varied teams and audiences
* Maintained brand consistency while offering room for customization
* Integrated visual elements from our annual campaign, reinforcing a cohesive look and feel
* Reduced custom asset requests, saving hours of design time each month

##### takeaways
## Consistent Flexible Design

* Consistency fuels confidence: When teams are equipped with materials that are both easy to use and visually cohesive, they’re more likely to adopt them, and stay on message.
* One brand, one story: Carrying campaign visuals (like pop-out and layered elements) across all materials helps reinforce a unified identity, no matter the medium while also keeping the content fresh and up-to-date.
* Time saved is value gained: A shared library of editable, brand-approved tools reduces design bottlenecks while maintaining quality.
* Smart collateral becomes foundational: These materials are more than one-off assets, they’re the framework for how SePRO shows up, communicates, and connects. And now that they are built they can easily be utilized and updated to fit evolving campaigns to keep SePRO at the forefront of visual impact.

##### continue to next case study
Revamping SePRO’s outdated water analysis report was no small feat; we transformed a dense, confusing document into an accessible, visually engaging resource. By incorporating feedback from scientists and modernizing the design, we’ve made it easier for customers to grasp crucial information and take action on their water quality.
